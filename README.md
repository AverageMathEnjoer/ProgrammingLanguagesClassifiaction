# Classification of Programming Languages

## Overview
This project aims to classify programming languages such as C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, Haskell, and F# using machine learning techniques. The classification is based on various features extracted from code snippets written in these languages.

## Technologies Used
- CatBoost by Yandex: CatBoost is a high-performance open-source library for gradient boosting on decision trees. It provides state-of-the-art accuracy, speed, and flexibility for classification tasks.
- Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of code snippets written in C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, Haskell, and F#. Each code snippet is labeled with the corresponding programming language. The features extracted from these code snippets will be used for training the classification model.

## Model Training
1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the code snippets, such as syntax patterns, keywords, and structural information.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and remove noise.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate machine learning model for classification tasks.
4. **Training**: Train the model on the preprocessed data using CatBoost and Scikit-learn.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different feature extraction techniques to improve model performance.
- Explore ensemble methods for combining multiple models to enhance classification accuracy.
- Incorporate deep learning models for language classification.
