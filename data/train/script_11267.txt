But %q also doubles every \'\\\'\' character.\n    ** %q is designed for use inside a string literal.  By doubling each \'\\\'\'\n    ** character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into\n    ** the string.\n    **\n    ** For example, assume the string variable zText contains text as follows:\n    **\n    ** <blockquote><pre>\n    **  char *zText = "It\'s a happy day!";\n    ** </pre></blockquote>\n    **\n    ** One can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:\n    **\n    ** <blockquote><pre>\n    **  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES(\'%q\')", zText);\n    **  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);\n    **  sqlite3_free(zSQL);\n    ** </pre></blockquote>\n    **\n    ** Because the %q format string is used, the \'\\\'\' character in zText\n    ** is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:\n    **\n    ** <blockquote><pre>\n    **  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES(\'It\'\'s a happy day!\')\n    ** </pre></blockquote>\n    **\n    ** This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL\n    ** would have looked like this:\n    **\n    ** <blockquote><pre>\n    **  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES(\'It\'s a happy day!\');\n    ** </pre></blockquote>\n    **\n    ** This second example is an SQL syntax error.  As a general rule you should\n    ** always use %q instead of %s when inserting text into a string literal.\n    **\n    ** The %Q option works like %q except it also adds single quotes around\n    ** the outside of the total string.  Additionally, if the parameter in the\n    ** argument list is a NULL pointer, %Q substitutes the text "NULL" (without\n    ** single quotes) in place of the %Q option.

If the third parameter, discard, is non-zero,\n    ** then the page should be evicted from the cache. In this case SQLite \n    ** assumes that the next time the page is retrieved from the cache using\n    ** the xFetch() method, it will be zeroed. If the discard parameter is\n    ** zero, then the page is considered to be unpinned. The cache implementation\n    ** may choose to reclaim (free or recycle) unpinned pages at any time.\n    ** SQLite assumes that next time the page is retrieved from the cache\n    ** it will either be zeroed, or contain the same data that it did when it\n    ** was unpinned.\n    **\n    ** The cache is not required to perform any reference counting.

The first argument passed to\n    ** an unlock-notify callback is a pointer to an array of void* pointers,\n    ** and the second is the number of entries in the array.\n    **\n    ** When a blocking connections transaction is concluded, there may be\n    ** more than one blocked connection that has registered for an unlock-notify\n    ** callback. If two or more such blocked connections have specified the\n    ** same callback function, then instead of invoking the callback function\n    ** multiple times, it is invoked once with the set of void* context pointers\n    ** specified by the blocked connections bundled together into an array.\n    ** This gives the application an opportunity to prioritize any actions \n    ** related to the set of unblocked database connections.\n    **\n    ** <b>Deadlock Detection</b>\n    **\n    ** Assuming that after registering for an unlock-notify callback a \n    ** database waits for the callback to be issued before taking any further\n    ** action (a reasonable assumption), then using this API may cause the\n    ** application to deadlock. For example, if connection X is waiting for\n    ** connection Y\'s transaction to be concluded, and similarly connection\n    ** Y is waiting on connection X\'s transaction, then neither connection\n    ** will proceed and the system may remain deadlocked indefinitely.\n    **\n    ** To avoid this scenario, the sqlite3_unlock_notify() performs deadlock\n    ** detection. If a given call to sqlite3_unlock_notify() would put the\n    ** system in a deadlocked state, then SQLITE_LOCKED is returned and no\n    ** unlock-notify callback is registered. The system is said to be in\n    ** a deadlocked state if connection A has registered for an unlock-notify\n    ** callback on the conclusion of connection B\'s transaction, and connection\n    ** B has itself registered for an unlock-notify callback when connection\n    ** A\'s transaction is concluded. Indirect deadlock is also detected, so\n    ** the system is also considered to be deadlocked if connection B has\n    ** registered for an unlock-notify callback on the conclusion of connection\n    ** C\'s transaction, where connection C is waiting on connection A.
