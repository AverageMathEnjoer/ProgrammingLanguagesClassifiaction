b'#\' Easily Play Notification Sounds on any Platform\n#\' \n#\' This package contains one function, beep(), with one purpose: To make it easy\n#\' to play notification sounds on whatever platform you are on. It is intended to\n#\' be useful, for example, if you are running a long analysis in the background\n#\' and want to know when it is ready.\n#\' \n#\' The package contains one main function \\code{\\link{beep}}, check it out to \n#\' see what it does. For sound on Windows and MacOS \\pkg{beepr} depends on the \n#\' \\pkg{audio} package. For sound on Linux \\pkg{beepr} depends on that either\n#\' the paplay utility from the Pulse Audio system, the aplay utility from the\n#\' ALSA system, or VLC media player (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) is\n#\' installed and on the PATH. Chances are that you already have one of these.\n#\' \n#\' @examples\n#\' # Play a "ping" sound\n#\' beep()\n#\' \n#\' @name beepr\n#\' @encoding UTF-8\n#\' @docType package\n#\' @author Rasmus B\xc3\xa5\xc3\xa5th < rasmus.baath@@gmail.com >\n#\' @import audio stringr utils\nNULL'
