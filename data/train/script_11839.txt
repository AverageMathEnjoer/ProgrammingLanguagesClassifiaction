b'#\' Tools to Quickly and Neatly Summarize Data\n#\'\n#\' \\pkg{summarytools} is a collection of functions which neatly and quickly\n#\' summarize numerical and categorical data. Data frame summaries, frequency\n#\' tables and cross-tabulations, as well as common descriptive (univariate)\n#\' statistics can be produced in a straightforward manner. Users with little to\n#\' no prior R programming experience but who are familiar with popular commercial\n#\' statistical software such as SAS, SPSS and Stata will feel right at home.\n#\'\n#\' These are the four core functions: \n#\' \\describe{\n#\'   \\item{dfSummary}{Extensive yet legible data frame summaries.}\n#\'   \\item{freq}{Frequency tables supporting weights and displaying proportions\n#\'   of valid and of total data, including cumulative proportions.}\n#\'   \\item{descr}{All common univariate descriptive stats applied to a single\n#\'   vector or to all numerical vectors contained in a data frame.}\n#\'   \\item{ctable}{Cross-tabulations for pairs of categorical variables -- \n#\'   accepting both numerical and character vectors, as well as factors.\n#\'   Choose between \\emph{Total}, \\emph{Columns} or \\emph{Rows} proportions,\n#\'   and optionally display chi-square statistic (with corresponding p-value), \n#\'   odds ratio, as well as risk ratio with flexible confidence intervals.}\n#\' }\n#\'\n#\' \\strong{Choice of output formats}:\n#\'  \\describe{\n#\'    \\item{plain ascii}{Ideal when showing results in the R console.}\n#\'    \\item{rmarkdown}{Perfect for writing short papers or presentations.}\n#\'    \\item{html}{A format very well integrated in \\emph{RStudio} -- but will\n#\'    work with any Web browser. Use the \\code{\\link{view}} function to display\n#\'    results directly in \\emph{RStudio}\'s viewer, or in your preferred Web\n#\'    browser.}\n#\'  }\n#\'\n"_PACKAGE"\n'
