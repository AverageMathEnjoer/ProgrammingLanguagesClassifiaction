The settings slow down \n  //   the filter as the negative charge is in the same direction \n  //   as a touch.  By slowing down the filter, touch signals \n  //   are "rejected" by the baseline filter.  While at the same time\n  //   long term environmental changes that occur slower than\n  //   at a touch are accepted.

Most electrodes will \n  //   work with this value even if they vary greatly in size and shape.  \n  //   The value of 0x0A or 10 in the release threshold register allowed \n  //   for hysteresis in the touch detection.\n  // Variation: \n  //   For very small electrodes, smaller values can be used and for \n  //   very large electrodes the reverse is true.

The values are base 2 exponential, thus \n  //   0x01 = 2ms, 0x02 = 4 ms; and so on to 0x07 = 128 ms.
